# price-tracker
A simple python app that checks the price of a product and sends a mail if it's on sales.

Command to run for imports:
pip install requests bs4

You need to replace the URL with the product's URL you are looking for.
You have to adjust the converted_price and the amount to be checked (ie. it works for double digits, but only watches the first two at four digits as well).

 I use two step verification and generated password through Google's App Passwords
 You need to log in with the email that you send from. Then you can send it do any number of accounts you may want.
